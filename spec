(1) RFC1945 was never meant to be a "specification".  It documents
a best guess as to what current practice was at the time it was
written.  Anyone who implements new software based only on this document
should be examined for mental problems.

(2) RFC1945 does not mention the Host header.

(3) However, the text in section 3.3 (about time formats) didn't change
much from RFC1945 to RFC2616.

Please do not refer people to RFC1945 in the future.  And please
make sure that nobody uses RFC2068 for anything!
